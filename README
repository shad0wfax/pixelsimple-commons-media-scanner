Commons Media Scanner Repository
-------------------------------

This project is an API for scanning media files from various systems. The API accepts a resource and based on the resource type, scans the resource and returns back a list of matching files.
The files can be filtered based on file extension names passed. 
For the first version this module just supports only directory scanning. It is easy to build http/ftp etc scanners as need arises and keeps the cliets agnostic of how the resource is fetched.
